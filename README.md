# BST_tree
The project involves analyzing insertion, deletion and search algorithms in the BST tree.
By changing the number of data (with random ordering) and the ordering of data (with a fixed number of data) in the program, the number of key operations had to be counted, the results analyzed and conclusions drawn.
## Description
The application was written in the Microsoft Windows operating system using the CodeBlocks integrated development environment (IDE). The programming language used was C++. The skeleton of the application was based on a graphical interface using the OpenGL graphics library and GLUT 3.7. 
The program shows the operation of insertion, deletion and search algotyms in the BST tree. The results are presented graphically - you can see the changes in the structure of the BST tree after completing the selected algorithm.
The user, after pressing the right mouse button, has the following options:
    - adding a new node,
    - searching for a node with the specified key value,
    - clearing the search results,
    - deleting a node,
    - generating a new tree randomly,
    - generating a new tree ascendingly,
    - generating a new tree decreasingly,
    - terminating the program.
